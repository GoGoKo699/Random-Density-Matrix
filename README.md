# Random-Density-Matrix

#### by  Ruge Lin

This is a repository for all code written for the article *Exact analytical relation between the entropies and the dominant eigenvalue of random reduced density matrices*. 

All codes are written in Python. Libraries required:

  - matplotlib for plots
  - numpy, statistics, random, time

#### Usage
In this example, there are files that output every plot in the article, generated with the real normal distribution.
An option of the complex normal distribution is provided in each python code. Please switch `normal`  from `'real' ` to `'complex'` in the code.

##### How to cite

If you use this code in your research, please cite it as follows:
