# Random-Density-Matrix

#### by  Ruge Lin

This is a repository for all code written for the article *Exact analytical relation between the entropies and the dominant eigenvalue of random reduced density matrices*. 

All code is written Python. Libraries required:

  - matplotlib for plots
  - numpy, statistics, random, time

#### Usage
In this example there are files that output every plots in the article, which were generated with real normal distribution.
An option of complex normal distribution is provided in each python code, please switch ''real'' to ''complex''.
