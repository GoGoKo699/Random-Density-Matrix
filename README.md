# Random-Density-Matrix

#### by  Ruge Lin

This is a repository for all code written for the article *Entanglement Trajectory and its Boundary*. 

All codes are written in Python. Libraries required:

  - matplotlib for plots
  - qibo 0.1.10 for quantum circuit simulation
  - numpy, tensorflow, statistics, random, time

#### Usage
In this example, there are files that output every plot in the article.
For random density matrices, an option of the complex normal distribution is provided in each python code. Please switch `normal`  from `'real' ` to `'complex'` in the code.
